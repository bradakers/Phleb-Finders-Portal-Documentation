# Stream

Stream in EspoCRM is a feed where you can see updates and new additions for records you follow. You are also can post messages to the own stream and to stream of another users.

By default the following entities have the stream: Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, Cases, Tasks. Administrators can enable or disable stream for a certain entity in [Entity Manager](../administration/entity-manager.md).

There are two kinds of stream in EspoCRM: record stream and user stream.

## Record Stream

Record Stream is shown in a Stream panel of a certain record on the detail view. Posts, updates and new additions related to the current record are displayed here.

## User Stream

Users can see their stream in Stream dashlet as well as under Stream tab. Users also can see stream of another users in the user's detail view, if they have access that is controlled by *User Permission* field in Roles.

In the user stream you can see posts and updates of records that the user follows. You can also see posts addressed to the user.

## Notifications

You will receive notifications about updates in your stream that were done by another users.

## Posts

You can create post related to a certain record. You are also able to attach multiple files and images to your post. If you want to **mention** somebody in your post, you need to type `@` symbol and start to type user's name. The user you has mentioned in your post will be notified about it.

## Posts to users

Users can create post to certain users, to certain teams, to all users and to self. Access for this ability is controlled by *Assignment Permission* field in Roles.

## Filtering

You can filter what to show in a stream: *All*, *Posts* or *Updates*.
